# Defect Process Analysis
## Analyse Jira workflow and Health of the organization

JIRA Ticket Analysis Agent that meets all your requirements. Here's what it does:

# Key Features:

First Response Time: Calculates time from ticket creation to first comment/response
Average Close Time: Measures total time from creation to resolution
Iteration Count: Tracks status transitions to measure workflow iterations
Comment Value Analysis: Uses LLM to score comment quality/value (0-10 scale)
Organizational Units: Counts different org units involved based on assignee history and participants

# Root Cause Classification:
The system classifies tickets into these categories:

Poor Requirement: Unclear, incomplete, or poorly defined requirements
Technical Debt: Legacy code issues, outdated dependencies
Unclear Scope: Scope creep, changing requirements
Communication Gap: Team misunderstandings
Resource Constraint: Insufficient time/people/tools
External Dependency: Third-party blockers
Testing Issue: Inadequate testing processes
Design Flaw: Poor system/UX design
